        <p>âœ¨HELLO I'M SHIN you can call me SHIN or SHINAYâœ¨</p>
        <p>
          I started out as a graphic designer, freelancing and running my own
          little printing hub where I laid out designs and brought ideas to life
          on paper. Eventually, curiosity pushed me past layouts and logos â€” and
          into code. Now, as a front-end developer, I get to design and build:
          crafting sleek, responsive websites that work as beautifully as they
          look.

          <p>
            âœ¨ As an INFJ, Iâ€™m equal parts dreamer and doer. I care deeply about
            people and love creating things that actually make a difference â€”
            whether itâ€™s a design, a website, or just a small detail that
            brightens someoneâ€™s day. I bring empathy, imagination, and a strong
            sense of purpose into my work, which means Iâ€™m not just building
            projects â€” Iâ€™m building experiences that connect.
